This will hold the python code for the cart pole demonstration.

The purpose will be to show that catastrophic forgetting affects the cart-pole simulation with a back propagation neural network.

This readme will be rewritten whenever there is work to show.

This program will require the neural network toolkit that is also hosted at github.org/bbitmaster
